        <h1 style="text-align:center">About Us</h1>
            <p style="text-align:left">The Irish Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals is Ireland's largest national animal welfare charity, and represents 20 affiliated member societies. Together the ISPCA and our members help, rescue, treat and responsibly rehome tens of thousands of animals of all different species.</p>

        <h3>'The Society Cares for all Animals'</h3><br/>

        <h1 style="text-align:center">Our Role</h1>
            <p style="text-align:left">Our role is to prevent cruelty to animals, to promote animal welfare and to pro-actively relieve animal suffering in Ireland.  The Society supports the aims of similarly minded animal welfare bodies throughout the world.  The ISPCA believes that animals have the right to live their lives free from needless suffering and we aim to rescue, rehabilitate and responsibly rehome animals that are subjected to cruelty or neglect.  We also believe that all animals have an intrinsic value entirely independent of their value or use to man and should be respected and protected accordingly. </p><br/>
        
        <h1>ISPCA Animal Centres</h1>
            <p style="text-align:left">The ISPCA's two rescue and rehabilitation centre's were developed in order to support the ISPCA Inspectorate and member societies with the rescue, rehabilitation and responsible rehoming of cruelly treated and neglected animals.

            The ISPCA National Animal Centre, Derryglogher Lodge, based in Keenagh, Co Longford opened in 2002 and is accessible to our Inspectors from across Ireland.  The centre is designed to provide veterinary care and rehabilitation to all animals subjected to cruelty or neglect and to return them to a state which enables them to be responsibly re-homed. The National Animal Centre can house over a 100 animals in need at any one time.

            The ISPCA Equine Rescue Centre is located in Mallow, Co Cork.  Following the huge increase in cruelty calls involving horses and ponies, the decision was taken to develop a centre for the rescue and rehabilitation of all equines.  Staff at the centre in Cork, care for many equines from the south of the country, and also collaborate closely with the equine unit in Longford. 

            The Cork and Longford Centre's both aid the Inspectorate and support the ISPCA's 20 Member Societies and other animal welfare organisations throughout Ireland.</p>
